# NIST-mM-Task
# SYNOPSIS
This program will go through a .tex file and convert all lower case "m"s to upper case and vice versa.

# CODE EXAMPLE
This program works by looking at individual characters in each line, checking if the character is an m and changing it accordingly

for line in userfile:

            for i in range(0,len(line)):
            
                if line[i] == "M":
                
                    word = str("m")
                    
                    newfile.write(word)
                    
                    print("m", end="")
                    
                    #characters being added to file printed for user convenience
                    
                elif line[i] == "m":
                
                    word = str("M")
                    
                    newfile.write(word)
                    
                    print("M", end="")
                    
                    #characters being added to file printed for user convenience
                    
                else:
                
                    word = str(line[i])
                    
                    newfile.write(word)
                    
                    print(line[i], end="")
                    
                    #characters being added to file printed for user convenience
